Cycling Club Events Database
============================

Work in progress. A database web application written in Node.js with Express, using MongoDB and Mongoose for the database. The app allows cycling club members to add upcoming events to the database, view the events. When finished the user will be able to edit and delete events as well as add themselves as a participant for an event.

No work has been done yet on the CSS side, so the interface is a little unexciting!
